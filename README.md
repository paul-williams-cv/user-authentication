# user-authentication
Requirement
Please create a class library with classes and unit tests that will handle the basic user login process for any application. The user should be able to register and then log in with an email and password. The registration should persist through application restarts. No front end code is needed and enough unit testing should be done to ensure everything works.

Comments
In order to get close to "any application" this solution is intended to multi-target .Net Standard 1.3 and .Net Framework 4.6.1.
